# WHYTGOD — Minimal Execution Flow

## 1. User Intent
A user or system submits an execution intent:
asset, amount, conditions, constraints.

## 2. Interface Intake
WHYTgod receives and validates the intent.
No custody. No execution yet.

## 3. Intelligence & Routing
WHYTgod evaluates routes, risk, efficiency,
and policy constraints.

## 4. Execution Dispatch
Execution instructions are sent to OFN-compatible
settlement or liquidity mechanisms.

## 5. Settlement
OFN performs settlement and finality.

## 6. Confirmation
WHYTgod receives confirmation and returns results.

## Summary
User → Intent → WHYTGOD → OFN → Settlement → Confirmation
