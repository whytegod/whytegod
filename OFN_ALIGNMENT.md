# Whytegod and OFN Alignment

## Purpose

This document explains how Whytegod aligns with the principles of the Open Financial Network (OFN).

It is descriptive, not promotional.

---

## Alignment Principles

Whytegod aligns with OFN through the following shared principles:

### 1. Intent-Based Finance

Whytegod treats user intent as the primary system input.

Users declare **what they want**, not **how execution must occur**, reducing complexity and risk.

---

### 2. Non-Custodial Architecture

Whytegod does not:
- Hold assets
- Control private keys
- Act as counterparty

Execution relies on external systems consistent with OFN’s non-custodial philosophy.

---

### 3. Open Interfaces

All protocol interfaces are:
- Explicit
- Minimal
- Inspectable
- Versioned

This supports OFN’s emphasis on composability and interoperability.

---

### 4. Separation of Responsibilities

Whytegod separates:
- Intent expression
- Validation
- Execution
- Settlement

No single component has unilateral control.

---

### 5. Verifiability

Execution outcomes are:
- Deterministic
- Traceable to intent
- Independently verifiable

Trust is minimized.

---

## Explicit Non-Alignment Areas

Whytegod does NOT claim alignment with:

- OFN governance decisions
- OFN economic models
- OFN deployment timelines
- OFN infrastructure guarantees

---

## Summary

Whytegod is designed to be:
- Compatible with OFN principles
- Conservative in claims
- Safe for discussion and review

Alignment is intentional, limited, and transparent.
