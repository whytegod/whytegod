# WHYTGOD Execution Roadmap

This roadmap defines the initial execution phases of WHYTGOD.
The focus is real-world utility, safety, and alignment with OFN.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation (Current)

Status:
- Protocol definition established
- Governance framework active
- Security policy published
- OFN alignment declared

Goal:
Create trust and clarity before writing production code.

---

## Phase 1 — Day 1 to Day 30 (MVP Definition)

Objectives:
- Define the minimum viable execution flow
- Specify supported P2P transaction types
- Define trust and dispute boundaries
- Design the execution interface (non-custodial)

Deliverables:
- Execution flow specification
- System architecture outline
- Initial interface mock or schema

Outcome:
WHYTGOD becomes a clearly defined execution layer, not an idea.

---

## Phase 2 — Day 31 to Day 90 (Prototype)

Objectives:
- Implement a basic execution coordinator
- Integrate with OFN-compatible rails
- Enable limited P2P execution scenarios
- Internal testing and validation

Deliverables:
- Working prototype
- Test cases
- Security review checklist

Outcome:
WHYTGOD executes real transactions in controlled conditions.

---

## Phase 3 — Expansion (Post-90 Days)

Objectives:
- Expand supported assets and flows
- Harden security and monitoring
- Prepare for external users or partners

Deliverables:
- Public-facing documentation
- Extended security review
- Deployment strategy

---

## Guiding Principle

WHYTGOD prioritizes execution integrity over growth.
Features are added only when safety and clarity are preserved.
