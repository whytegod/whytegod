# WHYTGOD Security Policy

WHYTGOD prioritizes security, safety, and responsible disclosure.

As an execution layer built on OFN, WHYTGOD does not custody user funds and does not operate as a settlement layer.

---

## Security Scope

Security considerations include:
- Execution logic
- Agent behavior
- Integration boundaries
- Governance controls

WHYTGOD minimizes attack surface by design.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security issue:
- Do NOT disclose publicly
- Do NOT exploit the issue
- Report responsibly

Contact: security@whytgod.org (placeholder)

## Incident Response

In the event of a critical vulnerability:
- Execution may be paused
- A fix or mitigation will be prioritized
- A public disclosure will follow resolution

---

## Dependency Trust

WHYTGOD depends on:
- OFN protocol integrity
- External infrastructure availability

If OFN is compromised, WHYTGOD execution may be suspended.

## Status

This security policy is active.
