# OFN Status & Alignment

## Current Status
Whytegod is not yet deployed as a live module within the OFN network.

Whytegod currently operates as an OFN-aligned execution protocol specification.

## Alignment Summary
Whytegod aligns with OFN at the architectural level through:

- Intent-first execution model
- Solver-based optimization flow
- Role-separated execution (Requester, Solver, Matcher, Validator, Executor)
- Schema-defined intents and validation

These components match OFN’s modular execution philosophy.

## Integration Readiness
Whytegod is prepared for OFN integration pending:

1. Runtime adapter implementation
2. Solver registration compatibility
3. Validator interface binding
4. Execution settlement hooks

## Public Claim Policy
Whytegod may accurately be described as:

✔ “OFN-aligned”
✔ “Designed for OFN compatibility”
✔ “Built with OFN execution principles”

Whytegod should not be described as:

✖ “Live on OFN”
✖ “Deployed on OFN”
✖ “An official OFN module”

until formal integration is completed.
