# WHYTGOD Governance Framework

This document defines how authority, decisions, and responsibility are handled within the WHYTGOD system.

WHYTGOD operates as an execution layer on top of the Open Financial Network (OFN), and inherits OFN’s core principles while maintaining its own operational governance.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Execution over speculation**
2. **Accountability over anonymity**
3. **Intelligence over automation**
4. **Stewardship over ownership**

---

## Roles

### Steward
The Steward is responsible for:
- Directional integrity
- Final arbitration
- Protocol alignment with OFN
- Protection of system purpose

Initially, the Steward role is held by the project initiator.

---

### Contributors
Contributors may:
- Propose changes
- Submit modules
- Improve documentation
- Audit components

Contributors do not override Steward authority.

---

## Decision Flow

1. Proposal is submitted
2. Reviewed for alignment
3. Tested or simulated if technical
4. Approved or rejected by Steward
5. Logged publicly

---

## Change Control

- Governance changes require explicit documentation
- Emergency pauses may be enacted by the Steward
- Rollbacks must be publicly recorded

---

## Alignment with OFN

WHYTGOD governance:
- Does not override OFN protocol rules
- Operates as a dependent execution layer
- May be disabled if OFN security is compromised

---

## Status

This governance framework is active and enforceable.
