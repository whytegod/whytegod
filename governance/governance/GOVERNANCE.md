# WHYTGOD Governance Framework

WHYTGOD operates under a minimal, execution-focused governance model designed to ensure integrity, alignment, and safety.

Governance exists to protect users and the protocol — not to extract rent.

---

## Governance Principles

- Execution-first, not speculation-first
- Minimal surface area
- Clear authority and accountability
- Alignment with OFN core principles

---

## Roles

### Steward
The Steward is responsible for:
- Strategic direction
- Governance enforcement
- Emergency decisions

The Steward may pause execution in the event of:
- Security threats
- OFN instability
- Systemic risk

---

### Contributors
Contributors may:
- Propose improvements
- Submit code or documentation
- Participate in reviews

Contributors do not have unilateral execution authority.

---

## Decision Making

- Normal changes require Steward approval
- Security or emergency actions override standard process
- Governance may evolve as the system matures

---

## Audits and Review

WHYTGOD may undergo:
- Internal reviews
- External audits (when applicable)

Audit findings will be addressed transparently.

---

## Alignment with OFN

WHYTGOD inherits trust assumptions from OFN.
If OFN governance materially changes, WHYTGOD governance may be updated accordingly.

---

## Status

This governance framework is active.
