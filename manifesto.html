  <h1>The Whytegod Manifesto</h1>
  <p>
    A declaration of intent —  
    not to dominate systems,  
    but to make them humane.

  <h2>We believe systems should serve humans</h2>
  <p>
    Most modern systems are built for speed,
    profit,
    and control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans are expected to adapt —
    even when the system is hostile.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whytegod rejects this.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="belief">
  <h2>We believe intent comes before execution</h2>
  <p>
    Humans think in goals, not instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forcing people to act like machines
    creates stress, mistakes, and loss.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whytegod separates *what you want*
    from *how it happens*.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="belief">
  <h2>We believe clarity is a form of security</h2>
  <p>
    Complexity hides risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a user cannot understand a system,
    the system already has too much power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whytegod favors explainable behavior
    over clever abstractions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="belief">
  <h2>We believe trust must be earned, not assumed</h2>
  <p>
    Trust is not a promise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trust is the result of consistent,
    observable behavior over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whytegod is designed to be audited —
    not worshipped.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="belief">
  <h2>We believe slow systems can be strong systems</h2>
  <p>
    Speed without understanding
    is just panic in disguise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whytegod values correctness,
    reversibility,
    and safety.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="belief">
  <h2>We believe humans are still learning</h2>
  <p>
    People make mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Systems should account for that —
    not punish it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whytegod is built for imperfect users
    living in imperfect conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>This is not a product</h2>
  <p>
    Whytegod is a protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does not promise wealth.
    It does not promise speed.
    It does not promise shortcuts.
  </p>
  <p>
    It promises structure,
    intention,
    and restraint.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>If this feels different, that is intentional</h2>
  <p>
    Whytegod is not trying to replace everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    It exists as an alternative —
    for those who want systems
    that feel calm instead of aggressive.
  </p>
