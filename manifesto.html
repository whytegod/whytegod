    <h1>The Whytegod Manifesto</h1>

    <p>
      We live in a world where value moves slower than intention.
      Where trust is outsourced.
      Where access is gated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Systems were built to serve coordination,
      but over time they became instruments of control.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Whytegod exists because permission was never meant to be a requirement.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Whytegod is not here to replace institutions.
      It is here to make them optional.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe intent is the most powerful primitive.
      Before money.
      Before contracts.
      Before platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      When intent can move freely,
      humans coordinate naturally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whytegod is a protocol for alignment —
      not enforcement.
      A system that listens before it executes.
    </p>

    <p>
      No central owner.
      No hidden levers.
      No artificial scarcity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built to be simple.
      Designed to be resilient.
      Allowed to evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a product launch.
      This is not a trend.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">This is infrastructure for people who still believe coordination can be honest.</span>
    </p>

    <div class="closing">
      Whytegod is not finished.  
      It is being revealed.
