    <h1>Manifesto</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod exists to remove unnecessary complexity from money, software,
      and financial systems. Technology should serve people, not confuse them,
      trap them, or extract from them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whytegod is not built to trade attention.
      It is built to restore control.
    </p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Money was meant to be a tool, not a weapon.
      Software was meant to empower, not gatekeep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whytegod prioritizes simplicity over noise, utility over speculation,
      and freedom over permission.
    </p>

    <h2>Decentralization</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod relies on mathematics, open systems, and verifiable logic —
      not institutions, personalities, or intermediaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      No single actor controls the system.
      Decentralization is not marketing. It is survival.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Privacy is not secrecy. Privacy is dignity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whytegod treats privacy as a default, not an upgrade.
      Users should not need permission to exist or transact.
    </p>

    <h2>Utility Before Value</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod does not promise price.
      It promises function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Value is not forced through hype.
      It emerges through use.
    </p>

    <h2>The Ordinary Man</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod is designed for the everyday person.
      No financial background. No insider language. No artificial barriers.
    </p>

    <p>
      A system that excludes the majority is not innovation.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod evolves through transparent rules, not emotional decisions.
      Governance exists to protect the system, not dominate it.
    </p>

    <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod is built for decades, not cycles.
      Its strength is patience.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quiet system.
      A useful system.
      A system that works.
    </p>

    <footer>
      <p>
        Whytegod is an open protocol.<br />
        No permission is required to use or implement it.
