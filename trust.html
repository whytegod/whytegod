    <h1>Trust, Compliance & Risk Disclosure</h1>

    <p>
      Whytegod operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading desk.
      We prioritize transparency, security, and responsible execution
      for all buy and sell requests.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Our Service</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod is not a bank, not a brokerage, and not an automated exchange.
      All transactions are handled manually and reviewed by our operations desk.
    </p>

    <p>
      By submitting an order, you acknowledge that you are requesting
      a peer-to-peer transaction facilitated by Whytegod.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Risk Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk, including
      price volatility, liquidity risk, and regulatory uncertainty.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Crypto prices may change rapidly</li>
      <li>Transactions are irreversible once confirmed</li>
      <li>You are responsible for providing accurate details</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should only trade amounts you can afford to lose.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Compliance & Verification</h2>
    <p>
      To prevent fraud, money laundering, and abuse, Whytegod may request:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Proof of payment</li>
      <li>Wallet ownership confirmation</li>
      <li>Identity verification (where required)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Failure to comply may result in order cancellation.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Financial Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod does not provide investment, legal, or financial advice.
      All decisions are made solely by the user.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Whytegod shall not be held liable for losses resulting from:

      <li>User error</li>
      <li>Third-party service failures</li>
      <li>Regulatory changes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Contact & Resolution</h2>
