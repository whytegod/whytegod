# Contributing to Whytegod

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Whytegod**.

Whytegod is an AI-first, peer-to-peer financial execution protocol built on top of the Open Financial Network (OFN).  
This repository currently serves as a **protocol specification and reference standard**, not a production implementation.

We welcome thoughtful, high-quality contributions that improve clarity, correctness, and extensibility.

---

## Scope of Contributions

At this stage, we accept contributions in the following areas only:

### ✅ Accepted Contributions
- Clarifications or improvements to documentation
- Corrections to protocol logic or flow descriptions
- Enhancements to intent schemas or validation rules
- Reference implementations (non-production, illustrative)
- Security considerations and threat modeling
- Edge cases or failure-mode analysis

### 🚫 Not Accepted (for now)
- Tokenomics or economic models
- Marketing or promotional content
- Claims of adoption or partnerships
- Production deployments
- DAO or governance expansion beyond specification

Keeping scope narrow is intentional and protects protocol integrity.

## How to Contribute

1. Open an Issue first  
   - Clearly describe the problem, proposal, or improvement  
   - Reference the relevant document or section  

2. Fork the repository  
   - Create a branch with a clear name (e.g. `schema-validation-fix`)  

3. Make focused changes  
   - Keep commits small and well-described  
   - Avoid unrelated edits  

4. Submit a Pull Request  
   - Explain why the change is needed  
   - Reference the issue it addresses  
   - Be explicit about assumptions or trade-offs  

---

## Design Principles

All contributions must align with these principles:

- Intent-first execution
- Protocol neutrality
- Minimal trust assumptions
- Explicit boundaries
- Human-readable and machine-readable parity

If a change violates one of these, it will not be merged.

---

## Review Process

- All submissions are reviewed for:
  - Conceptual correctness
  - Alignment with OFN principles
  - Long-term protocol coherence
- Maintainers may request changes or clarification
- Rejection does not imply lack of value — only misalignment with current scope

---

## Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to act professionally and respectfully.

This is a technical standards effort.  
Signal over noise.

---

## Questions

If something is unclear:
- Open an issue
- Be precise
- Avoid assumptions

By contributing, you agree that your contributions may be incorporated into the Whytegod protocol specification.
